# jline_AGN_fitting

Example semi-package to demonstrate how to auto-document code using `sphinx` and `readthedocs`, for the Kathmandu Astrophysics School 2020.

The code makes a vague attempt at fitting AGN emission lines from a specific spectral cube. This code is not useful for science, it's more a demonstration of `python` techniques to motivate how to add noice `docstrings`. You have been warned.
